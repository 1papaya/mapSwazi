When you break it down, most of the mapping done on #mapSwazi is done by tracing satellite imagery into important features such as buildings and roads, and adding information about those features.

All of the data generated in the #mapSwazi initiative is done through a platform called OpenStreetMap, so at a minimum you will have to sign up an OpenStreetMap account in order to contribute.
