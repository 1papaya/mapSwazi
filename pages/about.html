            <div class="content has-text-justified">
            <p>In January 2016 a group of students from the University of Colorado Boulder arrived in Swaziland to establish a footbridge building program enabling safe community access across rivers.</p>
            <p>After a country-wide survey mission and partnership forged with <a href="http://microprojects.co.sz">Swaziland MicroProjects</a>, we coalesced various powers at be to build our first <span class="is-italic">tebetebe</span> (footbridge) at eDlangeni in July 2017.</p>
            <p>The program has since grown to involve many more communities and university teams, and has merged with the NGO Engineers in Action to become the <a href="http://eiabridges.org">EIA Bridge Program</a>.
            <p>#mapSwazi has grown out of a need for map data in performing these community development projects in poorly mapped, rural regions in eSwatini.</p>

                <p>Travelling through the <span class="is-italic">boondoos</span> (rural regions) to visit sites and meet with community leaders has proven a time-consuming and cumbersome process, hindered by the difficulty of navigation. Mapping helps us navigate in these areas.</p>
                <p>Further, we are piloting an initiative to map all the river crossings in the country as a way to remotely identify footbridge need and improve the efficiency of our survey process.</p>
                <p>All the data contributed is <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap_License">free for anyone to use</a>, both the data itself and for navigation on apps such as <a href="http://maps.me">MAPS.ME</a></p>
                <p>This initiative is heavily inspired by that of <a href="http://maplesotho.com">#MapLesotho</a>, a similar project whos community has made Lesotho the best mapped country on the continent.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="content has-text-justified">
                <p>We launch the initial phase to map roads, waterways, and waterway crossings to help identify footbridge need, and so we have tasks with which we can form an eSwatini mapping community around.</p>
                <p>While this initiative is starting with a specific agenda, it is a community-driven project we are open to the wishes of the community to steer our efforts to map other features and regions.</p>
                <p>To all those who have an interest in humanitarian mapping, footbridge building, and/or eSwatini, we would love for you to be a part of the #mapSwazi initiative!</p>
